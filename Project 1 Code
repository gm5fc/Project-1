#Select columns that I am interested in further analyzing

#Filter to include only high protein items

#Generate output

## LOAD

#Convert the file from CSV to JSON
import json
#Use dataframe.to_json function, entering protein_breakfast dataframe as argument
result = protein_breakfast.to_json(orient="split")
#Parse the data
parsed = json.loads(result)
#JSON string representation of the python dictionary object is returned
